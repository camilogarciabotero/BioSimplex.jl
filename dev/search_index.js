Each row of the matrix corresponds to a different indicator: xr, xg, and xb.\n\nThe function uses the following precedent methods:\n\nxr(sequence, i): Returns the indicator for the presence of the nucleotide 'r' at position i in the sequence.\nxg(sequence, i): Returns the indicator for the presence of the nucleotide 'g' at position i in the sequence.\nxb(sequence, i): Returns the indicator for the presence of the nucleotide 'b' at position i in the sequence.\n\nThose methods are called the RGB indicators of a DNA sequence in a defined tetrahedron space called a simplex. Mathematically, the nucleotides can be represented in a tetrahedron space by adopting a coordinate system with the following basis vectors:\n\nbeginaligned\n A rightarrowleft(a_r a_g a_bright)=mathbfk \n C rightarrowleft(c_r c_g c_bright)=frac-sqrt23 mathbfi+fracsqrt63 mathbfj-frac13 mathbfk \n G rightarrowleft(g_r g_g g_bright)=frac-sqrt23 mathbfi-fracsqrt63 mathbfj-frac13 mathbfk \n T rightarrowleft(t_r t_g t_bright)=frac2 sqrt23 mathbfi-frac13 mathbfk\nendaligned\n\nThe RGB indicators are then calculated as follows:\n\nbeginaligned\n x_rn=fracsqrt23left(2 u_Tn-u_Cn-u_Gnright) \n x_gn=fracsqrt63left(u_Cn-u_Gnright) \n x_bn=frac13left(3 u_An-u_Tn-u_Cn-u_Gnright)\nendaligned\n\nFinally, the simplex space is a 3D space where the RGB indicators are used to represent the DNA sequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#BioSimplex","page":"Home","title":"BioSimplex","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"assets/logo.drawio.svg\" height=\"250\"><br/>\n  <i>Representing DNA sequences as tetahedrals (Simplex)</i>\n</p>","category":"page"},{"location":"#Overview","page":"Home","title":"Overview","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Representing DNA sequences as tetahedrals (Simplex)","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"This packages has a single public function biosimplex that takes a BioSequence and returns a Simplex representation of a BioSequence.
